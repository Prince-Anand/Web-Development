HTML Elements - A bunch of text having seprate section
HTML Tags - Used to create Elements
Markup Language -Its like Make this txt bold, make this para,etc...
<b> - bring attention to Tag(makes bold)
<p> - make a paragraph
Headings - <h1>---<h6>
<h1> - don't use headings for sizing , have only 1 <h1> on a page
use nested headings -> first only one h1, then, h2 inside h1 then, h3 inside h2 and so on....
